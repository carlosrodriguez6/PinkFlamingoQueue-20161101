# PinkFlamingoQueue

## Setup
The following tools are needed to build and run the project:
- git
- Xcode
- Cocoapods

### Cocoapods
`Podfile.lock` and all the associated pods are already pre-installed and included in the repository, but just in case there is an update, follow the instructions at https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html for installation.

### Remote API
The project needs a remote API to fully function. Either use a local copy of the Pink Flamingo project, or the provided URL. This has to specified in `APIDataManager.swift`.

## Running the project
Once the above steps have been completed, the project can be run by opening the `PinkFlamingoQueue.xcworkspace` from Xcode.
